## A Modern SPA Starter

> ðŸš§ **Work in Progress**
>
> Kaiju is currently in active development.

This project is inspired by the [T3 Stack](https://github.com/t3-oss/create-t3-app) but focuses on a different use case: making it easy to build and deploy single-page applications (SPAs) without the overhead of Next.js or server components, while keeping the backend as a separate application.

If your app doesnâ€™t need SSR, using a plain React setup with Vite and deploying it via CDN can be much simpler and cheaper. This starter provides a clean foundation for that kind of workflow.

Itâ€™s a reasonably opinionated boilerplate where every tool is carefully chosen to provide the best DX and TypeScript support. At the same time every piece is easily replaceable â€” you can swap Mantine for shadcn/ui, DrizzleORM for Kysely or Prisma, Hono for tRPC/Express/Nest and more, tailoring the stack to fit your preferences and needs.
